        data_source (str): The source dataset identifier which determines the scoring method.
        solution_str (str): The solution string to be evaluated.
        ground_truth (str): The ground truth answer for comparison.
        extra_info (dict, optional): Additional information that might be needed for scoring. Defaults to None.

               it returns the dictionary instead.

    Raises:
        NotImplementedError: If the reward function is not implemented for the given data source.
